# Introduction

## Reason
I love slotcar racing but I must say that the new Carrera Hybrid thing is very interesting. I also find the Sturmkind Drift Cars very interesting. In my opinion the thoughts behind these products are very good but the realization can be better, at least in my eyes. The main problems are the 1:50 scale (which must be 1:24 or 1:32 :) ), the bad controlling with smart phone or Controller which includes also the big latency caused by bluetooth.

## Main Object
The goal of this project is to create all features for a racing simulation with real scaled speed of RC-Cars with all needed elements.
1. A board with sensors for a car which controls speed and turning angle so that it behaves is realistic. In my opinion it would be great if this board is in between a "standard" receiver and "standard" ESC and servo.
2. A kind of control center which observes the race (laps, times, pit)
3. Additional sensors which supports that control center

## Secondary Objects
- "ghost" drivers

# Given
- I'm a hobby programmer, mainly in C, with Atmel microcontrollers. I would prefer this language but I'm open for other platforms like esp32c3.
- I would use available elements like RC-Components that simplify the building of a car
- I already made some calculations for the underlying physics which would made the programming relatively easy from that point


At the moment I mainly want to know if there are others which are interested in such a project. I'm from germany so any german answer is also welcome, just pull a request or create an issue.
